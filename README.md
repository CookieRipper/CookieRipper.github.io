# "private" RPG Wiki
This is a private RPG Wiki for me and my group.
The main language is german and all this is based on the Pathfinder 2e rule set from Paizo Inc. For further information, please see: cup.md and ogl.md (or the links on the rendered main page).

Please be aware that nearly anything in this repo is protected by copy-right, either because it's content from Paizo Inc., Ulisses Spiele GmbH or based on my own and therefore also tied to general german copy-right law stuff.

If you have cool ideas, feel free to start a discussion, if you find any grammar or missspelling errors make a pull request or open an issue.

Note: Due a frequently asked question, this has nothing todo with the Browser-extension called "CookieRipper". It's an unlucky circumstance, that my username is also the name of a piece of software.
